# Spanish Numbers Flashcards

## Introduction

I built this website to help my daughter. She was having trouble with the Spanish numbers 1 - 10, and so this website serves as a place for her to practice.

## Explanation

There are 10 flash cards here, one for each of the numbers 1 - 10. The user can click on the cad to begin. You should say the name (in Spanish) of the number displayed on the screen. You then have the option of deciding whether you got it correct or need additional practice.

The next card is selected based on [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling). If you are curious, you can check the `Results` page to see the distribution of the probability of getting each card correct.

The data is stored in the browser's local storage, and so will persist when you close the browser. However, it does mean that at the moment only one person's activity can be tracked per computer (/ browser). It also means that clearing local storage will remove all data.

If you have any improvements or suggestions, feel free to create an issue!
